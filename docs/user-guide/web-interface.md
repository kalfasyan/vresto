# Web Interface Guide

A professional, interactive map interface for searching Copernicus Sentinel satellite data with visual filters and instant results.

## Launch the Interface

```bash
make app
```

Or directly:

```bash
python src/vresto/ui/app.py
```

Opens at `http://localhost:8610` in your browser.

## ⚠️ Important: S3 Credentials Setup

**Without static S3 credentials, vresto will auto-generate temporary credentials with strict usage limits.** These temporary credentials have limited quotas and will be exhausted quickly with large downloads.

To avoid hitting quota restrictions, it's highly recommended to:

1. Request your own permanent S3 credentials from [Copernicus Dataspace](https://documentation.dataspace.copernicus.eu/APIs/S3.html#registration)
2. Configure them in your environment or `.env` file:
   ```bash
   export COPERNICUS_S3_ACCESS_KEY="your_access_key"
   export COPERNICUS_S3_SECRET_KEY="your_secret_key"
   ```
3. Or add them via the web interface (see **Settings → S3 Credentials** below)

Learn more in the [Setup Guide](../getting-started/setup.md).

- RGB composite builder
- **Preview** button to generate visualization
- In-browser preview area (heatmap, RGB, or band thumbnails)

## Tips & Workflows

### Find products by location
1. Open "Map Search"
2. Draw or click on the map
3. Set date range and filters
4. Press "Search Products"
5. Browse results and preview

### Find products by name
1. Open "Search by Name"
2. Type product name or pattern
3. Press search
4. View results and open quicklooks or metadata

### Download and analyze
1. Open "Download Product"
2. Enter product name or S3 path
3. Select bands and resolution
4. Set destination and press Download
5. Monitor progress on the right

### Inspect local files
1. Open "Product Analysis"
2. Point to a download folder and scan
3. Select product from list
4. Use preview controls to visualize bands

### High-Resolution Visualization (Hi-Res Tiler)
For full-resolution inspection, use the **Hi-Res Tiler** tab:
1. Select a product from your local downloads.
2. Select a preferred resolution (10m, 20m, 60m).
3. Toggle individual bands to instantly see them rendered as a map layer.
4. Use the map to zoom in and inspect fine details at the native resolution of the satellite instrument.

### Best Practices

- **Location searches** — Draw or mark a location before searching
- **Date ranges** — Use shorter ranges for faster results
- **Cloud cover** — Lower values = clearer images but fewer options
- **Preview resolution** — In-browser previews are optimized for lower resolution; use external tools for full-resolution analysis
- **Seasonal patterns** — Tropical regions have more clouds in rainy season; polar regions have limited winter daylight

## Keyboard & Controls

- **Map interactions** — Scroll to zoom, click-drag to pan
- **Notifications** — Brief confirmations appear at top
- **Modals** — Quicklooks and metadata open in dialog windows
- **Activity logs** — Scroll to review history in each tab
